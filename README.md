products (Nuts, Daal, Butter, Apple), reducing bulk orders and initiating daily
ordering for perishable items.
• Fast-Moving Items Boost: Shift shelf and promotional focus toward proven high-sale,
low-waste items (Shampoo, Cadbury, Tea Leaves), ensuring optimal inventory
allocation.
• Technology Introduction: Roll out digital daily sales and waste tracking for all shops.
Begin use of real-time dashboards to identify sales trends and waste spikes.
• Supplier Negotiations: Establish or renegotiate return policies, especially for
perishable and premium products.
• Incentive Launch: Introduce performance-based incentives tied to daily sales rate
improvements and waste minimization for managers and frontline staff.
• Baseline Training: Initiate foundational training sessions for all staff on correct
product handling, FIFO systems, and digital reporting tools.
• Location Strategy: Tailor interventions for SP_06, SP_10, and SP_03 by addressing
specific local challenges through targeted marketing, optimizing product mix to local
preferences, and improving foot traffic and accessibility incentives.
Key Goals –
• Reduce waste in loss-making shops by at least 12-15%.
• Increase sales of fast-moving items by atleast 15%.
• Achieve 100% adoption of digital tracking tools.
• Complete baseline staff training (product handling, inventory basics).
